"""
Purpose: Define an interface for creating an object but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

Pros:
- Encapsulates object creation.
- Supports open/closed principle by allowing new types without changing client code.

Cons:
- Adds complexity with extra subclasses.
- Clients may need to understand the product hierarchy.

When to use:
- When a class canâ€™t anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.
- To centralize and control complex creation logic.
